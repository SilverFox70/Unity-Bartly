# Unity/C# MVC Example
This is an example of using MVC within Unity along with a Factory Pattern Builder.

Many of the classes are portable outside of Unity as they do not rely on Unity's MonoBehaviour
in order to work. 

## Getting Started
You'll need to have Unity 5.5.0f3 installed. Clone the repo and open Unity. Search for the folder of the repo and open that in Unity. From there, it should be ready to go. 

## Notes
The file names should make this all pretty self explanatory in terms of what is going on. The only scripts that require Unity's underlying MonoBehaviour are **MainScript.cs** and **EnemyView.cs**.
